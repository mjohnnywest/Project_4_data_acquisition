# Project_4_data_acquisition
The Python portion of this project is designed to acquire the data to put into the dashboard of the project. It takes user inputs and credit card statements, and transforms the data into a format that our dashboard can read.

## Features

- Has a menu containing options for adding data, either manually, or using card statements
- Creates or overwrites dataframes for the dashboard to read
- Options to add several transactions of each type, in different currencies

## Requirements

- Python 3.13 or higher
- Any text editor compatable with ipynb files

Required libraries to pip install:

- pandas

- sklearn


## Usage

Ensure all required libaries are pip installed

Ensure "lending_data.csv" is in the "Resources" folder

Ensure the "Resources" folder is in the same folder as "credit_risk_classification.ipynb"

Open "credit_risk_classification.ipynb" with a text editor compatable with IYPNB files

Click "Run All" and allow the code to run

Ensure matricies and dataframes populate correctly

## Future Plans

In the future, basic AI models can be trained using supervised learning, and can be added to automatically categorize purchases 

The front-end could be implimented with Flask or Javascript to make a user friendly UI for adding data 

## Notes

Stack Overflow and Geeks for Geeks was used heavily in the writing of this code, and Claude AI was used to optimize code after it was written
